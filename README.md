## 📌 Project Overview

Big Mart is a retail chain with hundreds of outlets and thousands of products. The company has collected data on past sales, and we use that data to predict **Item Outlet Sales** — the total sales of a product at a particular store.

This notebook covers the full workflow:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model Evaluation


## 💡 Key Features

- 📊 Visualized insights from real-world sales data
- ⚙️ Applied feature engineering and label encoding
- 🧠 Trained and compared multiple regression models
- 📈 Evaluated model performance using R² Score
- 💾 Optionally supports submission generation (if `Test.csv` is available)
